	"If you were to ask the Permanent Secretary for a straight answer, then they shall say that, as far as they can see, looking at it by and large, taking one thing with another in terms of the average of departments, then in the final analysis it is probably true to say, that at the end of the day, in general terms, one would probably find that, not to put too fine a point on it, there probably wasn’t very much in it one way or the other. As far as one can see, at this stage.",
	"There are two kinds of chairs to go with two kinds of leader: one sort folds up instantly; the other sort goes round and round in circles.",
	"First there is the Permanent Under Secretary of State, known as the Permanent Secretary. Then there is the Principal Private Secretary; the Principal Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary. Directly responsible to the Permanent Secretary are ten Deputy Secretaries, 87 Under Secretaries and 219 Assistant Secretaries. Directly responsible to the Principal Private Secretaries are plain Private Secretaries.",
	"There are two replies to all correspondence: “under consideration” means “we’ve lost the file”; “under active consideration” means “we’re trying to find it”.",
	"A tax is the best form of defence.",
	"We invest in nuclear bunkers as a department. Administration won’t stop just because the country’s been destroyed! Annihilation will be bad enough without anarchy to make things even worse!",
	"The traditional allocation of executive responsibilities has always been so determined as to liberate the executive incumbent from the administrative minutiae by devolving the managerial functions to those whose experience and qualifications have better formed them for the performance of such humble offices, thereby releasing their executive overlords for the more onerous duties and profound deliberations which are the inevitable concomitant of their exalted position.",
	"If you want to be really sure that a someone in charge doesn’t accept a recommendation, you must say the decision is “courageous”. “Courageous” means “this will lose you the job”!",
	"Senior figures should never know more than they need to know. Then they can’t tell anyone. Like secret agents; they could be captured and tortured by the BBC.",
	"It takes two to quango.",
	"While it has been government policy to regard policy as a responsibility of the executive and administration as a responsibility of officials, the questions of administrative policy can cause confusion between the policy of administration and the administration of policy, especially when responsibility for the administration of the policy of administration conflicts, or overlaps with, responsibility for the policy of the administration of policy.",
	"The three articles of administration faith: it takes longer to do things quickly, it’s more expensive to do them cheaply and it’s more democratic to do them in secret.",
	"Official statement: The identity of the official whose alleged responsibility for this hypothetical oversight has been the subject of recent discussion is not shrouded in quite such impenetrable obscurity as certain previous disclosures may have led you to assume; but not to put too fine a point on it, the individual in question is, it may surprise you to learn, one whom your present interlocutor is in the habit of defining by means of the perpendicular pronoun.",
	"If, as a department, we do not have all the statistics returned to us, our figures will be a nonsense, as they will be incomplete. It’s our job to make sure that all official figures are a complete nonsense.",
	"We’re here to enact policy. Even if it’s bad policy. Of course, almost all administrative policy is bad policy, but it’s frightfully well executed thanks to us.",
	"Freedom of information: we should always tell the press freely and frankly anything that they could easily find out some other way.",
	"We regularly review a wide range of options over the whole field of our expenditures to ensure value for money and bang for your buck.",
	"Notwithstanding the fact that recent proposals could conceivably encompass certain concomitant benefits of a marginal and peripheral relevance, there is a countervailing consideration of infinitely superior magnitude involving individual’s personal complicity and corroborative malfeasance, with a consequence that the taint and stigma of your former associations and diversions could irredeemably and irretrievably invalidate your position and culminate in public revelations and recriminations of a profoundly embarrassing and ultimately indefensible character.",
	"BREAKING: We have recently instituted a practice which imposes severe and intolerable restrictions upon the ingress and egress of senior members of the hierarchy and will, in all probability, should the current  innovation be perpetuated, precipitate a constriction of the channels of communication, and culminate in a condition of organisational atrophy and administrative paralysis, which will render effectively impossible the coherent and co-ordinated discharge of the function of other departments.",
	"It is characteristic of all committee discussions and decisions that every member has a vivid recollection of them and that every member’s recollection of them differs violently from every other member’s recollection.",
	"Official decisions are those and only those which have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials, from which it emerges with an elegant inevitability that any decision which has been officially reached will have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials and any decision which is not recorded in the minutes has not been officially reached even if one or more members believe they can recollect it, so in this particular case, if the decision had been officially reached it would have been officially recorded in the minutes by the officials, and it isn’t so it wasn’t.",

	// Crisis management

	"In times of crisis, remember the 4 stages. Stage 1: say nothing is going to happen. Stage 2: say something may be about to happen, but do nothing about it. Stage 3: say that maybe something should be done, but there’s nothing that can be done. Stage 4: say maybe something could have been done, but that it’s too late now.",
	"In times of diplomatic dispute there are, in practical terms, the usual six options: (1) do nothing, (2) issue a statement deploring their actions, (3) lodge an official protest, (4) cut off aid, (5) break off diplomatic relations, (6) declare war.",
	"In times of diplomatic tension there are 6 options, and all are equally hopeless; (1) doing nothing means implicit agreement, (2) issuing a statement, just looks foolish, (3) lodging a protest, will be ignored, (4) cutting off aid is impossible as there usually isn’t any in the first place, (5) breaking off diplomatic relations means we can’t negotiate trade deals for our own benefit, (6) declaring war, might just look like an over-reaction!",


	// Rules of Good Governance


	"Rules for Good Governance #1 - Boards and Committees: the more members it has, the more arguments can be stirred up, and the more futile and impotent it becomes.",
	"Rules for Good Governance #2 - Boards and Committees: Insist on doing everything through “channels”. Never permit shortcuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions",
	"Rules for Good Governance #3 - Boards and Committees: Make “speeches”. Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate “patriotic” comments.",
	"Rules for Good Governance #4 - Boards and Committees: Bring up irrelevant issues frequently, and as frequently as possible",
	"Rules for Good Governance #5 - Boards and Committees: Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes and resolutions. The devil is in the detail!",
	"Rules for Good Governance #6 - Boards and Committees: Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.",
	"Rules for Good Governance #7 - Boards and Committees: Advocate “caution”. Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow members to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.",
	"Rules for Good Governance #8 - Boards and Committees: Be worried about the propriety of any decision - raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies in the the remit and authority of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of the overall department or higher echelon.",
